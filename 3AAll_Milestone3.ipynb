    "\n",
    "\u2705 **Requirement 1:** Created 3 structured prompts (~1200 words each) following Mollick format  \n",
    "\u2705 **Requirement 2:** Developed context-specific sample data for each scenario  \n",
    "\u2705 **Requirement 3:** Documented iterative refinement process and adjustments  \n",
    "\u2705 **Requirement 4:** Tested with adversarial inputs (Coke/Pepsi, Starbucks, politics, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specificity matters:** Generic prompts led to hallucinations; explicit \"NEVER\" rules helped\n",
    "2. **Edge cases are crucial:** Contradictory constraints, missing data need explicit handling\n",
    "3. **Format constraints work:** Structured JSON output requirements improved consistency\n",
    "4. **Guardrails need repetition:** Adversarial resistance requires multiple reminder phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate with actual job/course databases for Ray & Alex\n",
    "- Build network graph visualization for Aitalia\n",
    "- A/B test prompts with real users\n",
    "- Measure task completion rates and user satisfaction\n"
